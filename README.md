# Planting of the problem
Playing or taking chances is a random process, some people have their favorite numbers, others choose their numbers based on external factors. These second type of people tend to take a long time choosing and putting together their best numbers, this generates queues which translates into time that the customer must wait to make a chance or other operation, sometimes customers prefer to leave than wait.
optimize and provide a good service for these people and not generate congestion, agglomeration or abandonment of customers is the main thing.
what is proposed?
From patterns and characteristics of the person to create a program that can give recommendations of numbers that are likely to be liked by the customer. for this purpose having good quality data is essential.

 empty values, duplicate values and also replace values that mean the same thing but were written in a different way. Finally, we visualized if there were outliers for the numerical variables and decided if they are necessary or can be eliminated.
